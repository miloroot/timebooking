# Shift booking system.

A system where users of a company can register, and then add themselves to days/shifts they are free/available for work.
It's a system for employes thar are hired 'per-hour' or as 'extra-help'.

## Why I'm I doing this?

Many companies where I live, mostly in the elderly-care buisness, have a sloppy system for keeping track of their 
'extra' employes. Their contact info is often written down in a book, and then when they need the extra help,
they often have to call the entire list before they find someone that can work with short notice.

So with this system, the company can just log in, look at the calendar and see directly who to call.
Minimizing the time it takes to find someone available for work.
